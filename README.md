UC Berkeley developed pandas exercises using voter demographics from the 1996 US election to practice analyzing data with pandas as well as incorporating functions to help automate the tasks. 

The jupyter notebook contains the dataframe, the questions, and my solutions and comments. 

There was definitely much to learn about efficiently utilizing pandas and I have this project to thank for expanding my capabilities far beyond what I had learned!
